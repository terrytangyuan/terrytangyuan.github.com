While my official two-year anniversary is just a few days away, Thanksgiving feels like the perfect time to express my gratitude for this journey.

I still remember coming across a job posting shared by [Jeremy Eder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyeder/) in the [Kubeflow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kubeflow/) Slack channel. It described everything I hoped to do next. That led to interview panels with amazing colleagues ([Daniele Zonca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniele-zonca-9867807/), [Edson Tirelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edsontirelli/), [Jessica Forrester](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-forrester-a5bb747/), [Antonin Stefanutti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/astefanutti/)) and my manager [Taneem Ibrahim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taneemibrahim/) for the first year.

I’m deeply grateful to the Red Hat leadership, [John Graham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-j-graham/), [Sherard Griffin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherardgriffin/), [Steven Huels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenhuels/), [Taneem Ibrahim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taneemibrahim/), [Jennifer Albertson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-albertson/), [Chris Wright](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-wright-b733851/), and Matt Hicks, for their incredible support and trust, and for giving me the opportunity to take on technical leadership role working so closely with the open source community.

A heartfelt thank you to my mentors: [Daniele Zonca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniele-zonca-9867807/), [Jessica Forrester](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-forrester-a5bb747/), [Jason Greene](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-greene-7a72982/), and [Adam Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-miller-redhat/). My journey wouldn’t have been this fruitful without your support, guidance, and encouragement along the way.

Earlier this year, I was promoted to Senior Principal Engineer \- a milestone made possible by the incredible mentors and colleagues who supported me along the way. I’m especially grateful to those who took the time to write thoughtful reference letters.

None of this would have been possible without my wife and our three wonderful kids. Thank you for being my foundation and inspiration.

To all the collaborators and partners in the open source community: thank you. Every conversation and collaboration has meant a lot.
