## Overview

### Archetypes

Four common archetypes (recurring character patterns) of Staff-plus roles:
* Tech Lead:
    * guide approach and execution of a particular team; work closely with a single manager
    * delegate projects across the team and grow their teammates; as the team's impact grows, tech lead's coding blocks shrink
    * this role is common among companies using agile methodologies. An organization needs roughly one tech lead for every eight engineers. It's common to perform the tech lead role without having the impact expected of a Staff-level engineer
* Architect:
    * responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a critical area; combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership
    * responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within the company where the domain must be both complex and enduringly central to company's success
    * maintain an intimate understanding of the business' needs, their users' goals, and the relevant technical constraints
    * use insight to identify effective approaches within their area of focus via organizational authority they've earned by demonstrating consistently good judgement
    * this role tends to evolve in large companies
* Solver:
    * dig deep into complex problems, find path forward, and continue to work on them until they're resolved
    * generally operate on problems that are identified as organizational priorities
* Right Hand:
    * extend executive's attention, borrow their scope and authority to operate complex organizations
    * operate as a senior organizational leader without direct managerial responsibilities
    * remain deeply aligned with that leader's approach, beliefs, and values
    * often dive into a fire, edit the approach, and delegate execution to the appropriate team

The architect and right hand roles have generally emerged as the organizations reached 100 and 1000 engineers. The solver and right hand are tightly aligned with executive priorities and are likely to receive recognition for addressing leadership's most pressing problems.

### What do they actually do?

* Working on projects/efforts that have strategic value for the company while driving technical design and up-leveling their team
* Setting technical direction: understanding and solving the real needs of the organization around you and far less about prioritizing technology and approaches that you personally are excited to learn about
* Mentoring and sponsorship: growing the engineers around you then through personal heroics
* Providing engineering perspective: reviewing contracts for potential enterprise customers; getting pulled into the room where decisions are happening; injecting engineering context and perspective into a decision; representing the interests of all of engineering, not just your own
* Exploration: companies either learn to explore or they fade away;
