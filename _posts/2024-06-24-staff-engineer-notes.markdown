## Overview

### Archetypes

Four common archetypes (recurring character patterns) of Staff-plus roles:
* **Tech Lead**:
    * guide approach and execution of a particular team; work closely with a single manager
    * delegate projects across the team and grow their teammates; as the team's impact grows, tech lead's coding blocks shrink
    * this role is common among companies using agile methodologies. An organization needs roughly one tech lead for every eight engineers. It's common to perform the tech lead role without having the impact expected of a Staff-level engineer
* **Architect**:
    * responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a critical area; combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership
    * responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within the company where the domain must be both complex and enduringly central to company's success
    * maintain an intimate understanding of the business' needs, their users' goals, and the relevant technical constraints
    * use insight to identify effective approaches within their area of focus via organizational authority they've earned by demonstrating consistently good judgement
    * this role tends to evolve in large companies
* **Solver**:
    * dig deep into complex problems, find path forward, and continue to work on them until they're resolved
    * generally operate on problems that are identified as organizational priorities
* **Right Hand**:
    * extend executive's attention, borrow their scope and authority to operate complex organizations
    * operate as a senior organizational leader without direct managerial responsibilities
    * remain deeply aligned with that leader's approach, beliefs, and values
    * often dive into a fire, edit the approach, and delegate execution to the appropriate team

The architect and right hand roles have generally emerged as the organizations reached 100 and 1000 engineers. The solver and right hand are tightly aligned with executive priorities and are likely to receive recognition for addressing leadership's most pressing problems.

### What do they actually do?

* Working on projects/efforts that have strategic value for the company while driving technical design and up-leveling their team
* **Setting technical direction**: understanding and solving the real needs of the organization around you and far less about prioritizing technology and approaches that you personally are excited to learn about
* **Mentoring and sponsorship**: growing the engineers around you then through personal heroics
* **Providing engineering perspective**: reviewing contracts for potential enterprise customers; getting pulled into the room where decisions are happening; injecting engineering context and perspective into a decision; representing the interests of all of engineering, not just your own
* **Exploration**: companies either learn to explore or they fade away; group trusted individuals with broad skills, allocate resources, and check back later to see what they've discovered (one of those engineers is often a Staff engineer)
* **Being glue**: doing the needed, but often invisible, tasks to keep the team moving forward and shipping its work
* **Writing software**: the higher you get, the more your job becomes about mentoring and growing the people around you; building company's tech branch, noticing larger tech trends that can be improved upon or corrected, helping to set the tech vision for your team/company; reading code and doing a fair number of code reviews
* **Slow but rewarding**: it's normal to end some days as a Staff-plus engineer feeling like you haven't accomplished anything - keep at it!

## Does the title even matter?

* **Allowing you to bypass informal gauges of seniority**: a Staff-plus title allows you to reinvent the energy you've previously spent on proving yourself into the core work you're evaluated on
* **Facilitating access to "the room"**: a seat at the table in higher-level engineering discussions above individual projects and teams
* **Potentially increase career compensation**
* **Access to interesting work**: depends on archetypes (solvers: yes, tech lead: undermine the team if they operate that way)
* **Different rather than better**: being a Staff-plus engineer, especially a broad-scoped one, is a very different job than being a Senior engineer. It's important to take a step back and think about whether it's a job you really want
* **Material but not magic**: if you have a problem and believe that your title is the only thing holding you back, I'd like to reassure you that focusing on developing your approach and skills will be far more impactful than the title
