[Cloud Native AI Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/cloud-native-ai-day/) aims to merge two cutting-edge domains – cloud native technologies and artificial intelligence – with a day full of insightful sessions, hallway discussions, and networking opportunities like never before. This co-lo began at KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 as Kubernetes AI Day. Each year, it has seen several iterations, adapting to the rapidly changing landscape of both fields. This shift is an embodiment of how AI is not just about Kubernetes but impacts a wide variety of domains in the whole of cloud native. 

While AI has been the talk of the town, the general notion has been that AI is mainly hype and there is no real substance in the cloud native space. However, we want to bust this myth and showcase all the revolutionary work happening in the AI for cloud native and cloud native for AI space. We plan to highlight these wins and expand the excitement amongst cloud native engineers. Above all, we want attendees to recognize the boundless possibilities that exist at the intersection of cloud native and AI. This event aims to highlight not only how AI is relevant for cloud native but how cloud native goodness and best practices can help the AI tech stack. We aim to foster a community-driven dialogue that propels us towards a future where AI seamlessly integrates with cloud native infrastructure, unlocking unprecedented scalability, efficiency and innovation. 

Who will get the most out of attending Cloud Native AI Day?

Whether you are a seasoned practitioner or a curious newcomer, there’s something here for everyone to learn and get involved in the community. Given the scale of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, it can get pretty overwhelming so if you are looking for focused discussions this co-lo is your way to go! The Cloud Native AI Day is designed to cater to a diverse audience spanning various roles and expertise levels. Cloud native developers will gain valuable knowledge about integrating AI into their applications and optimizing their infrastructure. MLOps practitioners and data scientists seeking to leverage cloud native architectures for scalable model deployment and management will discover novel strategies and best practices. Open source contributors will get a chance to interact with maintainers and get involved in the cloud native and AI journey. Business leaders aiming to capitalize on the transformative power of AI will gain strategic perspectives and actionable takeaways.

In essence, anyone passionate about the future of AI and cloud native will find themselves at home in this dynamic ecosystem.

What is new and different this year?

2024 brings with it a wave of fresh innovations to Cloud Native AI Day. We are thrilled to introduce exciting breakout sessions featuring AI use cases from academia and innovations happening in CNCF projects working in the intersection of AI and cloud native. We have recently launched the [CNCF Working Group for Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/cncf/tag-runtime/blob/main/wg/cnaiwg.md) so expect a lot of hallway discussions around that. We are more than excited to provide networking opportunities for attendees to forge collaboration and build meaningful relationships with contributors around the globe.

What will the day look like?

Cloud Native AI Day is a full-day event and is packed with lightning talks, panel discussions, and breakout sessions. We are excited to bring you a stellar line up of diverse speakers covering various topics around developing and deploying AI applications on cloud native infrastructures to talking about futuristic use cases integrating AI with other cutting edge technologies like WebAssembly.

Should I do a bit of homework first?

While no prior preparation is required to fully engage with the Cloud Native AI Day, attendees may enrich their experience by keeping the following in mind:

*    Go through the [schedule of Cloud Native AI Day](https://colocatedeventseu2024.sched.com/overview/type/Cloud+Native+AI+Day) and bookmark talks you really want to attend. Focus on those that align with what you hope to take away from the event.
*     Research the speakers of the bookmarked sessions and the topics they are going to present. Identify meaningful questions that can be used to interact with the speakers and get involved with their work.
*    Look for the OSS projects that will be presented at the event and prepare to network with their contributors and maintainers if you plan on helping with the project.
*    For first time attendees, an event of this scale can seem challenging but do not be afraid to strike up a conversation and if it helps, identify a buddy for the conference, usually a seasoned contributor, and request intros with people that you want to interact with. We as co-chairs are more than happy to answer your questions and help you get the most out of this event so feel free to reach out to us!
