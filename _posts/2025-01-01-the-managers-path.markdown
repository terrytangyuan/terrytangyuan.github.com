# Management 101

## What to expect from a manager

* The experience of being managed is the foundation on which you build your own management philosophy
* Different management characters:
    * Benign neglect: the manager just leaves them alone entirely and the engineer just kind of knows what to work on
    * Neglectful manager: ignore you when you need help; avoid meeting with you; never give you feedback
    * Micromanager: questions every detail of everything you do and refuse to let you make any decisions on your own
    * Actively abusive manager: neglect you until they want to yell at you for something
    * Good managers: care about you as a person; actively work to help you grow; teach you important skills and provide valuable feedback; help you navigate difficult situations; help you understand what's important to focus on

## One-on-one meetings

* An essential feature of a good working relationship
* Purpose 1: Create human connection between you and your manager
* Letting your manager into your life a little bit is important: when stressful things happening, it will be much easier to ask your manager for what you need
* Great managers notice when your normal energy level changes and hopefully care enough to ask you about it
* Being an introvert is not an excuse for making no effort to treat people like real human beings
* The bedrock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust. Real trust requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other
* Your manager will hopefully treat you like a human who has a life outside of work, and spend a few minutes talking about that life when you meet
* Purpose 2: Provides a regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing
* Try put a little thought into the agenda before the meeting
* Good 1-1s are not status meetings for most people
    * If you are a manager reporting up to senior management, you may use it to discuss the status of critical projects
    * If you are an individual contributor, a 1-1 as a status meeting is repetitive and probably boring
    * If your 1-1 is a dreadful obligation for delivering a boring status report, try using email or chat for that purpose to free up time
* Encourage you to share the responsibility of having good 1-1s with your manager; prepare the time yourself; push to reschedule instead of cancellation

## Feedback and workplace guidance

* Not just performance reviews
* The only thing worse than getting behavioral feedback is not getting it at all or getting it only during your performance review
* The feedback ideally will be somewhat public if it's praise, and private if it's criticism
* Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something
* Asking your manager for advice is a good way to show that you respect her
* Your manager needs to be your number one ally
* If you are unhappy or need something, say it
* Managers sometimes assign stretch projects that help you grow; good managers will help you understand the value of the work you are doing even when it is not fun or glamorous
* As you become more senior, the amount of personal feedback decreases and expect the type of feedback to change from personal to team- or strategy-related input

## Training and career growth

* Your manager holds some responsibility for helping you find training and resources for career growth
* Expect that you are responsible for figuring out what types of training you want
* Promotion and compensation: guidance through the process of preparing promotion packet; your direct manager will usually be essential in advocating for your promotion and getting it approved
* Managers usually cannot guarantee promotions but good managers know what the system is looking for and can help you build those achievements and skills
* Opportunities for promotions are more rare for more senior levels; your manager may need you to find and propose achievements that qualify you for the next level
* Find the best managers and mentors you can and watch them work
* Try to find people to work for who push you to succeed but also reward you for success, who inspire you to stretch yourself

## How to be managed

* Spend time thinking about what you want
    * Your manager cannot read your mind; figuring out what you want to do, learn, and what will make you happy rests on your shoulders
    * There's much uncertainty in the world: once you get the job you thought you wanted, the enjoyment eventually fades and you find yourself looking for something else
    * Use your manager to discover what's possible where you are, but look to understand yourself in order to figure out where you want to go next
* You are responsible for yourself
    * Bring agendas to your 1-1s
    * Advocate for yourself
    * Take feedback graciously even when you don't agree with it
    * When you are persistently unhappy, say something
    * Set your own boundaries
    * Sometimes if you want a bigger job, you will have to work more hours to get it
    * If your manageris conscientious, she'll appreciate your candor
* Give your manager a break
    * She may be stressed out sometimes; she'll be imperfect and say dumb things, or do things that feel unfair or harmful to you
    * Her job is to do the best thing for the company and the team; not to make you happy all the time
    * Provide feedback but understand that she may not listen or change
    * As you become more senior, your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems
* Choose your managers wisely
    * Consider not only the job, company, and the pay, but also the manager when evaluating job opportunities
    * Strong managers know how to play the game at their company: get you promoted, get you attention and feedback from important people, have strong networks, get you jobs even after you stop working for them
    * There's a difference between a strong manager and a manager that you like as a friend, or even one you respect as an engineer
    * Plenty of great engineers make ineffective managers because they don't know or want to deal with politics of leadership
