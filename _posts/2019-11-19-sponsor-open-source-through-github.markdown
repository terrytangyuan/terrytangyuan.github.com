Hi everyone! I recently opened my [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/terrytangyuan). Your support would be really appreciated and would encourage my on-going involvements in the open source community! Follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TerryTangYuan) and [GitHub](https://github.com/terrytangyuan) for updates!

## What projects am I working on?

I (co-)authored the following open source projects grouped by area:
* Machine learning: [TensorFlow in R](https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow), [metric-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn), [dml](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/dml), [lfda](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/lfda), and [ftlib](https://github.com/caicloud/ftlib).
* Data visualization: [ggfortify](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) and [autoplotly](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/autoplotly).
* Tools: [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate), [scaffolder](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/scaffolder), [maintainer-tools](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/maintainer-tools), [jpmml-sparkml-lightgbm](https://github.com/alipay/jpmml-sparkml-lightgbm), and [onnx-r](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-r).

In addition, I am a [Project Management Committee (PMC)](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#PMC) member of the following two projects:
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) where I maintain the Python and R packages.
* [Apache MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) where I co-authored the Scala package.

In the meantime, I am also a [committer](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Committer) of the following projects:
* [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) where I am one of the core developers of [TensorFlow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02637) and maintainer of [TensorFlow I/O](https://github.com/tensorflow/io). I was also honored to receive the [Google Open Source Peer Bonus in 2016](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/data/docs/google-open-source-peer-bonus-program.png) for my contributions to TensorFlow.
* [ElasticDL](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/elasticdl) where I have designed and implemented several major components of the system.
* [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) where I am the co-chair of Distributed Training Working Group and the maintainer of [Kubeflow Common](https://github.com/kubeflow/common), [MPI Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator), [XGBoost Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/xgboost-operator), and [MXNet Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mxnet-operator).

There are also other projects that I have made non-trivial contributions to as I come across areas of improvements, namely [H2O](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3), [SQLFlow](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/sqlflow), [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), [MMLSpark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark), [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo), etc. Please visit my [projects page](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/projects/) and [GitHub page](http://github.com/terrytangyuan/) for more details.

## What else am I involved in besides writing code?

* I am an editor of [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) on areas of machine learning, distributed systems, and cloud computing.
* I served as mentor of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for [Kubeflow in 2020](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/data/docs/GSoC-Kubeflow-2020.png), [TensorFlow in 2019](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/data/docs/GSoC-TensorFlow-2019.png), and [R Project for Statistical Computing in 2016](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/data/docs/GSoC-MXNet-2016.png).
* I co-authored two best-selling books [*TensorFlow in Practice*](http://terrytangyuan.github.io/2017/02/12/tensorflow-in-practice-book-chinese/) and [*Dive into Deep Learning (with TensorFlow)*](https://d2l.ai/).
* I write [blogposts](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/) related to open source technologies and sometimes share my thoughts via [media interviews](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/tags/#Interview) to broader audience.
* I maintain two [CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/): [Model Deployment](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/ctv-model-deployment) and [Databases](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/ctv-databases) with R.

## How would your sponsorship support my work?

Your sponsorship will contribute directly to cover necessary expenses for developing, maintaining, and growing the projects, which includes but not limited to the following:
* Continuous integration, cloud services, and computing resources for testing related changes.
* Travel expenses for speaking at local meetups, universities, and conferences.
* Domains and hosting services for project websites.
* Licenses for various softwares that improve my work efficiency.
