Hi everyone! I recently opened my [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/terrytangyuan). Your support would be really appreciated and would encourage my on-going involvements in the open source community! Follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TerryTangYuan) for updates!

Here below is a brief summary of my roles and contributions to the open source projects I've been involved in.

I am a [Project Management Committee (PMC)](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#PMC) member of the following two projects:
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) where I maintain the Python and R packages.
* [Apache MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) where I co-authored the Scala package.

In the meantime, I am also a [committer](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Committer) of the following projects:
* [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) where I am one of the core developers of [TensorFlow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02637) and maintainer of [TensorFlow I/O](https://github.com/tensorflow/io).
* [ElasticDL](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/elasticdl) where I have designed and implemented several major components of the system.
* [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) where I am the maintainer of [Kubeflow Common](https://github.com/kubeflow/common), [MPI Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator), [XGBoost Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/xgboost-operator), and [MXNet Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mxnet-operator).

Additionally, I (co-)authored the following open source projects grouped by area:
* Machine learning: [TensorFlow in R](https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow), [metric-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn), [dml](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/dml), [lfda](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/lfda), and [ftlib](https://github.com/caicloud/ftlib).
* Data visualization: [ggfortify](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) and [autoplotly](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/autoplotly).
* Tools: [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate), [scaffolder](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/scaffolder), [jpmml-sparkml-lightgbm](https://github.com/alipay/jpmml-sparkml-lightgbm), and [onnx-r](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-r).

There are other projects that I have made non-trivial contributions to as I come across areas of improvements, namely [H2O](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3), [SQLFlow](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/sqlflow), [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), [MMLSpark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark), etc. Please visit my [projects page](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/projects/) and [GitHub page](http://github.com/terrytangyuan/) for more details.

Other things related to open source worth mentioning here are:
* I am an editor of [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) on areas of machine learning, distributed systems, and cloud computing.
* I served as mentor of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for [Kubeflow in 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5507335985823744), [TensorFlow in 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5358647872323584/), and [R Project for Statistical Computing in 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/5199297624670208/).
* I was awarded [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2016/09/google-open-source-peer-bonus-program.html) in 2016 for my contributions to TensorFlow.
* I authored the book [*TensorFlow in Practice*](http://terrytangyuan.github.io/2017/02/12/tensorflow-in-practice-book-chinese/) which is the first book teaching TensorFlow in Chinese and has been translated to several other languages.
* I write on open source technologies [here](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/) and share my thoughts via [media interviews](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/tags/#Interview).
* I maintain two [CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/): [Model Deployment](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/ctv-model-deployment) and [Databases](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/ctv-databases) with R.
