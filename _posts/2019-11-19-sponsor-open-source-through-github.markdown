Hi everyone! This is Yuan. I recently opened up [my Github Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/terrytangyuan). Your support would be really appreciated and would encourage my on-going involvements in the open source community!

Here below is a brief summary of my roles and contributions to the open source projects I've been involved in.

I am a [PMC](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#PMC) member with official oversight responsibilities to the following two projects:
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) where I maintain its Python and R packages.
* [Apache MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) where I maintain its Scala package.

In the meantime, I am also a [committer](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Committer) of the following projects:
* [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) where I am one of the main developers of [TensorFlow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02637.pdf) and maintainer of [TensorFlow I/O](https://github.com/tensorflow/io).
* [ElasticDL](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/elasticdl) where I have designed and implemented several major components of the system.
* [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) where I am the maintainer of [Kubeflow Common](https://github.com/kubeflow/common), [MPI Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator), and [XGBoost Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/xgboost-operator).

Additionally, I (co-)authored the following open source projects grouped by area:
* Machine learning: [TensorFlow in R](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/), [scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn), [dml](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/dml), [lfda](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/lfda), and [onnx-r](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-r).
* Data visualization: [ggfortify](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) and [autoplotly](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/autoplotly).
* Tools: [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate) and [jpmml-sparkml-lightgbm](https://github.com/alipay/jpmml-sparkml-lightgbm).


There are other projects that I have contributed to as I come across areas of improvements. Please visit my [projects page](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/projects/) and [Github page](http://github.com/terrytangyuan/) for more details.

Other things related to open source worth mentioning here are:
* I am an editor of [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) on areas of machine learning, distributed systems, and cloud computing.
* I served as mentor of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for [TensorFlow in 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5823672818860032) and [R Project for Statistical Computing in 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/5199297624670208/).
* I was awarded [Open Source Peer Bonus Award](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2016/09/google-open-source-peer-bonus-program.html) in 2016 for my contributions to TensorFlow.
* I authored the book [*TensorFlow in Practice*](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2017/02/12/tensorflow-in-practice-book-chinese/) which is the first book teaching TensorFlow in Chinese and has been translated to several other languages. I also write blogs on open source technologies and share my thoughts [here](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/).
