Hi everyone! This is Yuan. Here below is a brief summary of my roles and contributions to the open source projects I've been involved in.

I am a [PMC](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#PMC) member with official oversight responsibilities to the following two projects:
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) where I maintain its Python and R packages.
* [Apache MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) where I maintain its Scala package.

In the meantime, I am also a committer/maintainer of the following projects:
* [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) where I am one of the main developers of [TensorFlow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02637.pdf) and maintainer of [TensorFlow I/O](https://github.com/tensorflow/io).
* [ElasticDL](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/elasticdl) where I designed and implemented several major components of the system.
* [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) where I am the maintainer of [Kubeflow Common](https://github.com/kubeflow/common), [MPI Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator), and [XGBoost Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/xgboost-operator).

Additionally, I also (co-)authored numerous open source projects in areas of:
* Machine learning: [scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn), [dml](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/dml), and [lfda](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/lfda)
* Data visualization: [ggfortify](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) and [autoplotly](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/autoplotly).
* Distributed systems. 

I am a [PMC](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#PMC) member of [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and [Apache MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) as well as a committer of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [ElasticDL](https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/elasticdl), and [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow). I also (co-)authored numerous open source projects in areas of machine learning, data visualization, and distributed systems. Please visit the [projects page](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/projects/) on my [personal website](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/about) for more information.

Your support would be really appreciated and would encourage my on-going involvements in the open source community!
